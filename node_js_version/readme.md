This is a template for python projects.

Protocol:
- delete .venv directory because it's large
- copy this folder where ever and rename to the project name
- add to requirements.txt (example: BeautifulSoup4)
- run `sh reset_env.sh`
- select all code in `generate_dataframe.py` and press `shift + enter` to test
- no need for jupyter notebooks
