PROFESSOR ALAIN VIEL: In your everyday life,
you are surrounded by living organisms, non-living things.
What does make the difference between the two?
Are there special atoms, chemicals, found only in living organisms?
In this video, you will discover that inert and living matters are in fact
not distinguished by the chemical elements they contain,
but by the relative abundance of these elements and the connection
they make with each other.
What are the major atoms found in living versus inert matter?
This periodic table shows a small number of elements labeled in green.
These are the major components of living organisms.
They are combined to form a large number of biomolecules that
vary both in structure and complexity.
The elements labeled in yellow are present in trace amounts in living
organisms but still have vital roles that will be discussed in later videos.
As you can see on this table, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen
make up 95% of the weight of a human body.
Carbon by itself represents 50% of desiccated living matter.
In contrast, in Earth's crust, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen
are present in low or trace amounts.
In contrast, oxygen, silicon, aluminum, and iron
are the major components of the crust.
Why is so much carbon needed in living organisms?
Aside from water, the majority of biomolecules are carbon-based.
It is efficient for living organisms to use one atom for a lot of purposes.
It's extreme versatility makes carbon a unique atom.
Carbon can be used to build molecules of different shapes and geometry.
Linear chains, branched chains, cyclical structure.
This structural diversity leads to functional diversity.
So let's take a look at a carbon atom.
Carbon has six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons.
The number of electrons and their position in atomic orbitals
are key to carbon's versatility.
Electrons are distributed in space with specific shapes called orbitals.
For carbon, the first two orbitals, each containing two electrons, are spherical
and they are called 1s and 2s.
The 2s orbital is further away from the nucleus than the 1s.
Carbon has also three equivalent barbell-shaped orbital
called to 2px, y, and z.
The remaining two electrons are unpaired and each occupies one 2p orbital,
leaving the third orbital, 2pz unoccupied.
Remember, covalent bonds between two atoms
are found when one orbital for each atom, carrying an unpaired electron,
fuse into a molecular orbital which will now contain two electrons.
Based on my description of the carbon atom, with it's two unpaired electrons,
one could predict that a carbon atom can only form two covalent
bonds with other atoms.
But you probably know some molecules where carbon makes four bonds.
Methane, a byproduct of the metabolism of some bacteria,
is one of such molecule, where one carbon forms
four bonds with hydrogen atoms, as you can
see on the three-dimensional structure.
I will take this opportunity to describe how we will represent molecules
in three dimensions.
The bonds depicted by straight lines on this figure,
are in the plane of the screen.
The bond represented by a solid wedge sticks out of the screen towards you.
And the bond represented by a hashed wedge
sticks backwards behind the screen.
How can carbon make four covalent bonds?
The electrons in carbon can shift around.
And one electron from the 2s orbital can be promoted to the empty 2pz orbital.
Now the 2s and the three 2p orbitals contain each an unpaired electron.
So in theory, now four covalent bonds can be formed,
but would be unequal since unpaired electrons are not
on identical orbitals.
Unequal bonds are very unstable.
So what's the solution?
Promoting one electron is not sufficient.
The orbitals must also undergo a process called hybridization.
The hybridization of the four orbitals equalizes the characteristics
of the four unpaired electrons.
The newly formed sp3 orbitals have 25% s character and 75% p character.
On this diagram, we can see the four sp3 orbitals of carbon
needed to form a molecule of methane.
These orbitals spread themselves into space
as far from each other as possible.
Each fuses with the s orbital of an hydrogen atom,
forming four identical bond at 109.5 degrees from one another.
The carbon occupies the center of a geometric shape
called a tetrahedron, with the four hydrogens at the vertices.
Now how can carbon make bonds with three, and not four of the atoms?
In biomolecules such as ethylene, a plant
hormone controlling the ripening of fruits, each carbon bonds three atoms,
two hydrogen and the other carbon.
In this case, electrons have to rearranged differently
around the carbon atom.
In other words, a different type of hybridization occurs.
Once again, one electron from the 2s orbital is promoted to a 2p orbital.
However, only three and not four hybrid orbitals are formed.
These are called the sp2 orbitals and they are
33% s character and 67% p character.
The sp2 orbitals arranged in a planer trigonal structure
120 degree apart from each other.
The remaining unpaired electron still occupies a 2p orbital.
This 2pz orbital is orthogonal to the plane containing the sp2 orbitals.
To make ethylene, two trigonal structures come together.
Two sp2 orbitals fuse head to head to form a sigma covalent
bond between the two carbons.
The sideways overlap of the two 2pz orbitals
lead to the formation of a new covalent bond called
a pi bond between the two carbons.
Each of the remaining four sp2 orbitals fused
with the 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form four carbon hydrogen bonds.
In ethylene, the two carbons are linked by a double bound.
One sigma and one pi bond.
The electrons involved in the pi bond occupy a ring-shaped space
between the two columns.
Finally, how can carbon bond with two other atoms?
Once again, one electron from 1s orbital is promoted to the empty 2p orbital.
And then two of the orbitals carrying unpaired electrons are hybridized.
The result are two sp orbitals with 50% s character and 50% p character.
The sp orbitals are 180 degrees from each other.
The other two unpaired electrons remain on 2p orbitals, 2py and 2pz.
When two of these linear structures come together,
two sp orbitals overlap head to head to form
a sigma bond between the two carbons.
Sideways overlaps between pairs of two 2p orbitals on each carbon
leads to the formation of two pi bonds between carbons.
Therefore, the two carbons are connected by a triple bond.
Finally, the other sp orbitals carried by the two carbons
fuse with the 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms
to form two carbon hydrogen bonds.
The molecule formed is acetylene.

Acetylene is not produced by living organisms,
but can be made synthetically and used to ripen fruits.
Acetylene is extremely combustible due to the instability of the triple bonds.
This instability might explain why almost no biomolecule
contains a triple bond.
So now what are the consequences of the various types of bonds
found in biomolecule?
Different bonds affect the geometry and the reactivity of biomolecules.
As you can see on this table, we can consider three characteristics.
First, we will consider the differences in bond length.
The shape of a molecule is determined by the type of atom's bond.
For example, a bond between an oxygen and a hydrogen
is shorter than a single bond between two carbons.
The shape of the molecule is also determined by the presence
of a single versus a double bond.
As you can see on the table, the length of a double bond between two carbons
is shorter than the length of a single bond between two carbons.
The second characteristic to take into account is the strength of the bond.
Different bonds have different strengths.
For example, the bond strength between carbon linked by a double bond
is higher, as you might expect, than that of carbon linked by a single bond.
But not twice as high.
Therefore, the pi bond is weaker than the sigma bond.
And the presence of a double bond increases the reactivity of molecule,
because you have now a bond that is weaker and can break easily.
The third characteristic is the electronic activity.
When two different atoms are engaged in covalent bond,
one electron has a stronger pull on the electrons.
This property is called electronegativity.
The difference of electronegativity determine the relative position
of the electrons in the molecule or orbital between two atoms.
And that will affect the reactivity of the molecule,
in particular its ability to donate and receive electrons in an oxidation
reduction reaction.
So in this video, you have learned how carbon
can create a wide variety of structure, based on the physical
and chemical nature of carbon bonds.

ALAIN VIEL: Atomic composition is not the only factor that
determines the identity of a molecule.
Some molecules have the same atomic composition
but have different three-dimensional structures.
In our example here, maleic and fumaric acids have the same composition,
but the double bond blocks the free rotation about the carbon-carbon axis.
Interconversion is prevented unless covalent bonds are broken.
The two molecules are said to have different configurations.
They are also called stereoisomers.
Maleic acid, with its two bulky groups represented in purple on this diagram,
are on the same side of the double bond.
And this molecule corresponds to the cis configuration.
Fumaric acid, with its two bulky groups on opposite side of the double bond,
corresponds to the trans configuration.
A double bond is not a prerequisite to have configurational isomers.
Molecules with the same composition, and containing a chiral center,
can also exist in different configurations.
So what is a chiral center?
It is a place in a molecule where a carbon is
bound to four distinct chemical groups.
In our example, the chiral carbon is linked to one hydrogen
and to three distinct chemical groups, R1, 2, and 3.
If the carbon was linked to one hydrogen, to the group R2,
and to two identical groups R1, the carbon would be said achiral.
Depending on how the four groups are arranged around the chiral carbon,
different configurational isomers are formed.
Once again, a switch from one configuration to another
requires the breaking of covalent bonds.
The two different configurations of a molecule containing a chiral center
are called enantiomers.
Enantiomers are mirror images of each other, as you can see on this diagram.
No matter how you rotate the original chiral molecule,
you never obtain its mirror image without breaking covalent bonds.
In contrast, you can obtain the mirror image of an achiral molecule
by simple rotation of the chemical groups.
This is a similar concept to our hands and feet.
As you can see on this diagram, our feet are mirror images of each other.
Now take a look at my hands.
If I show you the palms of my two hands, they are mirror images of each other.
My thumbs point toward each other.
I need to rotate one of my hand to have my two thumbs pointing
in the same direction.
But now you can see the palm of one of my hand and the back of the other hand.
I would have to cut, rearrange, and glue back some fingers
to show you the palm of my hands and have
my thumbs pointing in the same direction,
and I'm not ready to do that.
So what are the biochemical consequences of having
molecules in different configurations?
The interaction between ligands and their receptors in cells
are stereospecific.
Molecules with the same composition but different configurations
bind to different receptors, thereby increasing functional diversity.
In our example, (R) and (S)-Carvone are two enantiomers and are mirror images
of each other.
They bind to distinct receptors on nerve cells in your nose.
The binding of (R)-Carvone to its specific receptor leads to a sensation
of a fresh spearmint smell.
The binding of (S)-Carvone to its specific receptor leads
to the perception of a pungent caraway smell.
AUDIENCE: So double bonds don't allow any rotation,
but what about single bonds?
ALAIN VIEL: Single bonds do allow free rotation.
The different spatial arrangements of a molecule caused by free rotation
are called conformations, not to confuse with configuration.
The switch from one conformation to another
does not require the breaking of a covalent bond.
In theory, molecules can adopt an infinite number
of possible conformations.
However, some are more stable than others and become prevalent.
Take this molecule of ethane for example and consider
two of its conformations shown on the graph.
These conformations result from a rotation of a methyl group, CH3,
about the carbon-carbon bond located in the center of the molecule.
The graph shows the potential energy of these two extreme conformations,
one having the hydrogen eclipsed with one another, one having the hydrogen
staggered apart.
Due to steric hindrance, the staggered confirmation
has a lower potential energy.
As we'll learn, it means that the staggered conformation
has a higher stability than the eclipsed conformation.
The free rotation gives flexibility to biomolecules
and allows biomolecules to reach their most stable conformation.
